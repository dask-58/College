## **Bit Manipulation**

To give all the possible subsets, we just need to exhaust all the possible combinations of the numbers. And each number has only two possibilities: either in or not in a subset. And this can be represented using a bit.

Using  `[1, 2, 3]`  as an example,  `1`  appears once in every two consecutive subsets,  `2`  appears twice in every four consecutive subsets, and  `3`  appears four times in every eight subsets (initially all subsets are empty):

```
[], [ ], [ ], [    ], [ ], [    ], [    ], [       ]
[], [1], [ ], [1   ], [ ], [1   ], [    ], [1      ]
[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [ ], [1   ], [2   ], [1, 2   ]
[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), p = 1 << n;
        vector<vector<int>> subs(p);
        for (int i = 0; i < p; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i >> j) & 1) {
                    subs[i].push_back(nums[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return subs;
    }
};
```
